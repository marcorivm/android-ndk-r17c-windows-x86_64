If you are getting the following error while trying to buy an older android project `No toolchains found in the NDK toolchains folder for ABI with prefix: mips64el-linux-android` and you don't want to update the project you can download these files and place them inside the ndk-bundle folder, by default in Windows it will be here `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk-bundle\`
